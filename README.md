### A website where buyers can shop across multiple stores.

This is a website where users can signup as a seller with either Google OAuth, or email and password. Once the seller is logged in, they can create multiple shops, and add or delete products from their shops. Buyers can search the website or visit a variety of shops to add products to their cart for a one time transaction.
